## "is x abandoned ?"

How much time i have available is hard to predict and my priorities shift rapidly.  
[My forks](https://github.com/Jan9103?tab=repositories&q&type=fork&language&sort) are just for pull requests.  
[My archived repos](https://github.com/Jan9103?tab=repositories&q&type=archived&language&sort) are "abandoned", superseeded, or similar.  
[All other repos](https://github.com/Jan9103?tab=repositories&q&type=source&language&sort) are active (if they are in "maintenance" mode i will write it into its README).
